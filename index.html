          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>My name is Jamie, and I am an aspiring Front End Web Developer. I began my career in Customer Service and Account Management, before moving into more technical roles involving Business and Software Analytics. Having recently emigrated from the UK to Singapore with my wife, I decided to take the opportunity to retrain as a Developer - something I'd been considering for several years. I may be new to the game, but I am constantly improving and developing my rapidly expanding skillset.</p>
